Participating in the 2024 Women Who Code (WWC) Python Days of Code Challenge

I have committed to participating in the challenge for the next 60 days, January 10 - March 10, 2024.
Through a WWC Slack Channel, each day a new Python prompt was delivered to be solved.
Each completed prompt has been included here.
