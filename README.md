Participated in the 2024 Women Who Code (WWC) Python Days of Code Challenge

I committed to participating in the challenge for the total 60 days, January 10 - March 10, 2024.
Through a WWC Slack Channel, each day a new Python prompt was posted to be solved. Each completed prompt has been included here.

I decided to participate in this challenge to take a personal initiative in developing my understanding of the Python language. My overall goal of the challenge was to develop enough of a basic understanding to build my own creative projects afterwards.
